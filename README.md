# COMP5046 Assignment 1

<h1>Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks</h1>
<p><b>In this assignment1, we will focus on developing sentiment analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). </b><br/>
Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helps a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. <b><i>- refer to Lecture5</i></b></p>


<h2>1. Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you are to use the [dataset description]<br/>
Both the training and testing sets are provided in the form of [dataset form] () and can be downloaded from the Google Drive using the provided code in the Assignment1 Template ipynb.<br/><br/>
In this Data Preprocessing section, you are required to implement the following functions: <br/>
  <i><b>Preprocess data</b>: You are asked to pre-process the training set by integrating several text pre-processing techniques (e.g. tokenisation, removing numbers, converting to lowercase, removing stop words, stemming, etc.) - Please refer to Lab 5. You should justify the reason why you apply the specific preprocessing techniques</i>
</p>


<h2>2. Model Implementation</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you are to use the [dataset description]</p>


<h2>3. Evaluation</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you are to use the [dataset description]</p>


<h2>4. Documentation</h2>
<p>In the section 1,2, and 3, you are required to describe and justify any decisions you made for the final implementation. You can find the tag ‘[Justify your decision]’ for the point that you should justify the purpose of applying the specific technique/model.<br/>
For example, for section 1 (preprocess data), you need to describe which pre-processing techniques (removing numbers, converting to lowercase, removing stop words, stemming, etc.) were conducted and justify your decision (the purpose of choosing a specific pre-processing techniques, and benefit of using that technique or the integration of techniques for your AI) in your ipynb file</p>
